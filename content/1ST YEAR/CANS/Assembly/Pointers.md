A pointer is an address which holds a value; Both the address and the value are [[1ST YEAR/How to Learn a New Language/Variables/Variables]] which are generally stored in [[RAM|Main Memory]] and loaded to the [[Registers|Register]] when needed

Pointers can be used as an alternative to labels, where & denotes the address, and * denotes the value, for example:

```
@x ( address of x )
*x ( value x points to )
```


Pointers are useful for reusing code as the same code can be executed with pointers set to different addresses

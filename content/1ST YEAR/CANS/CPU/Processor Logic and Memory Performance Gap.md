Since memory is much slower than CPU, there is a performance gap bottlenecking the system.

Can be addressed by:
- Increasing number of [[Bits]] retrieved at once
	- Wider rather than deeper [[RAM]]
- Reduce frequency of access to memory
	- More complex [[Cache]]
	- Cache on chip
- Increase interconnection bandwidth
	- High speed [[Bus|Busses]]
	- Hierarchy of buses

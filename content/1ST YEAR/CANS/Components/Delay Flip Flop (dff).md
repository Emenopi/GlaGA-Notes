The dff is a circuit that remembers one [[Bits|Bit]] of data (the state)
State is set to input bit every clock tick

Clock ticks are points in time
Clock cycles are intervals between two ticks


The clock must be run slowly enough to ensure all signals become valid
- Determined by the slowest blob of combinational logic
	- This is the upper limit for CPU clock

Computation requires potential difference on a wire to represent information

- Analogue Representation:
	- PD can take all possible values between certain range - [[1ST YEAR/How to Learn a New Language/Variables/Variables]] are made proportional to PD
	- + Can be extremely fast e.g. differential equations
	- - Limited precision
	- - Errors accumulate after multiple calculations
	- - Hard to represent data other than real numbers

- Digital Representation
	- Express information using discrete values rather than proportional to PD
	- + Good immunity to noise
	- + Errors don't accumulate after multiple calculations
	- + All datatypes can be represented

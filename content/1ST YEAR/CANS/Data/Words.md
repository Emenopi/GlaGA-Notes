Similar to a Byte, but can have any size

- Short word : 16 bits
- Word : 32 bits
- Long word : 64 bits

A word containing k [[Bits]] is called a k-bit word and can represent 2<sup>k</sup> values

The term 64-bit architecture means that the internal hardware of a CPU uses mostly 64-bit words

Generally, larger word sizes yield faster performance and can address more [[RAM|Memory]]

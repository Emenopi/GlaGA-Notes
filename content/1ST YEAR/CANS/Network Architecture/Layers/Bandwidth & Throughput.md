The frequency range which a channel can transport, measured in Hz. Affects the maximum transmission rate (throughput) as per: R<sub>max</sub> = 2H log<sub>2</sub> V where R is transmission rate(in bits per second), H is bandwidth, and V is number of discrete values per symbol. Throughput is fundamentally limited by bandwidth and [[Channel Capacity|SNR]]

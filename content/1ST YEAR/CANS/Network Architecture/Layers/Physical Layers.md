A network [[Layers|Layer]] concerned with transmission of physical bits e.g. wired, wireless

Its main consideration is how to transfer a series of bits over an analogue channel subject to noise and limitations

Wired examples could be:
- Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):
	- An electrical cable using two unidirectional wires twisted together (one for signal, one for ground)
	- Twists reduce interference: more twists = less noise
	- Long cable lengths possible with low data rate, but susceptible to noise at larger lengths
	- Widely used e.g. ethernet, telephone
- Optical Fibre
	- Glass core contained in plastic jacket, somewhat fragile
	- Unidirectional data using lasers
	- Very low noise, high capacity, and cheap to make

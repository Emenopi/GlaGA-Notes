Involves encoding digital signals to analogue for transmission, usually by varying PD in a cable or light intensity in the case of fibre optics. Many encoding schemes exist for this.

- Baseband data encoding:
	- Signal in original frequency range, encoded by changing PD
	- Used in ethernet via Manchester coding

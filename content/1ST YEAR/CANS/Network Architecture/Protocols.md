An agreed language for encoding messages between network layers and rules defining meaning of the messages, and when they can be sent

Communication occurs when two or more hosts exchange messages, each [[Layers|Layer]] has it's own protocol

The messages need to follow a particular syntax, agreed semantics, and well defined interactions - A network protocol defines all three of these

Protocols have certain standards which act as a formal description of them to ensure interoperability of diverse implementations

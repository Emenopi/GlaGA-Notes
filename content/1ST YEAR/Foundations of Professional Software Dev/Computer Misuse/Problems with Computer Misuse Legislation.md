The [[Computer Misuse Act]] has had a number of issues with implementation, namely:

- Companies may be reluctant to admit their system was compromised due to potential business losses
- Lack of police resources and cost of external experts
- Many convictions failed due to legal technicalities
- Sentences for successful convictions towards lower margin
- More publicity for cases with unsuccessful convictions

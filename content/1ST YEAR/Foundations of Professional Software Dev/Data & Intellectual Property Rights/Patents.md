Patents give exclusive rights of usage to the owner of an invention. It must be filed for, and cannot be disclosed to the public beforehand.

In order for something to patented, it must:
- Be new
- Include an inventive step
- Capable of industrial application
- Not in an area specifically excluded

Patents may be of little use to individuals and small businesses as they are unlikely to be able to cover the legal costs associated with enforcing the patent

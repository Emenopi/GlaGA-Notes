Naming conventions involve using one of the following cases:
- lowercase: Used for directory and [[Packages]] names
- PascalCase: Used for [[Classes|Class]] names
- camelCase: Used for [[Object Oriented Programming|Object Oriented]] [[Functions|Methods]] and [[1ST YEAR/How to Learn a New Language/Variables/Variables]]
- snake_case: Used for Python [[Functions|Methods]] and [[1ST YEAR/How to Learn a New Language/Variables/Variables]]
- UPPERCASE: Used for [[Enums]]

Naming conventions exist for:
- [[Naming Conventions (Packages)|Packages]]
- [[Naming Conventions (Classes)|Classes]]
- [[Naming Conventions (Methods and Variables)|Methods and Variables]]

Additionally, names should be dissimilar to other names used as they could easily be confused

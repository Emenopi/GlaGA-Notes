Coupling is a measure of how interdependent the modules in an [[Applications|Application]] are.
An application which has modules which all rely upon each other has high coupling, whereas one which is designed such that each module performs a singular standalone function and not reliant upon other modules is said to have low coupling.

Coupling comes in various forms:
- [[Data, Stamp, and Data-Structured Coupling]]
- [[Control Coupling]]
- [[External Coupling]]
- [[Common Coupling]]
- [[Content Coupling]]
- [[Temporal and Sequential Coupling]]
- [[Communicational Coupling]]
- [[Functional and Interaction Coupling]]
- [[Component Coupling]]

Data coupling occurs when modules are linked due to the passing of data between them.

Stamp coupling occurs when the entire data structure is passed between modules and may be necessary for efficiency

Data-Structured coupling is similar to stamp coupling, but instead of the data-structure being passed between two modules, it is accessed separately by them

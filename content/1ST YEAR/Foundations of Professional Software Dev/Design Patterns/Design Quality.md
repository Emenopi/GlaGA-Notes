A well designed software is maintainable, scalable, and reliable.

This can be measured on three separate levels:
- Functions
- Modules
- Application

Each of these levels should ideally serve only one purpose.

The degree to which modules and the application as a whole meet this requirement is measured by [[Coupling]] and [[Cohesion]], respectively. Ideally there should be high cohesion and low coupling.

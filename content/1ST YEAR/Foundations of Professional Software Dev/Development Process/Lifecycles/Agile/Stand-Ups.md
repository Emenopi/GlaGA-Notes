A Stand-Up is a daily meeting of developers and others involved such as the project owner to discuss their progress and aims, and self-organise.

Daily Stand-Ups are one of the [[12 Principles of Agile]] and therefore fundamental to the [[Agile]] [[Development Process]]. They should be short in duration - no longer than one can comfortably stand up for.

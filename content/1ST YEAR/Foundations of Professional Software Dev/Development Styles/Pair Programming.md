Pair Programming is a [[Development Styles|Development Style]] involving two developers. One developer (the "driver") conducts the programming, while another (the "observer") watches to provide feedback and catch mistakes. Usually the driver and observer will switch places at regular intervals.

The benefit of this type of development style is that it adds an extra layer of [[Code Review]] to the [[Development Process]] as the observer is essentially reviewing in real time. Additionally, this style is of particular use when one developer is less experienced as they are able to discuss and observe the process of a more experienced developer and share applicable knowledge.

In contrast to [[Single Person Development]], there is no single point of failure in pair programming, which results in a more reliable process with improved quality of code.

Pair programming, however, has the potential to be more costly due to taking a longer time and halving the available number of tickets which can be worked on at any one time.

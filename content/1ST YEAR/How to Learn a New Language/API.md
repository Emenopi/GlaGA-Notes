An API (Application Programming Interface) allows interconnection between [[Applications]] and services. They are often used to import external functionality or data.

Web based APIs will specify an "endpoint" or URL to send requests to. This can be appended with [[Parameters]] to receive only specific data from the endpoint location

Usually APIs require the requester to authenticate themselves either by an authenticator such as OAuth or a secret key

Functions (or Methods) are callable sub-programmes which may or may not return a value.

Functions are [[Blocks]] of code which temporarily reroute the flow of execution. They often take [[Arguments]]

Functions are used to remove repetition and allow for [[Abstraction]], Decomposition, Isolation, and Parameterisation.

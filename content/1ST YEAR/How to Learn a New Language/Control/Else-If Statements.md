Else-If [[Statements]] are [[Conditionals|Conditional]] logic to affect the [[Control Flow]] of a programme when there are more than two possible scenarios.

They expand on [[If Statements]] by adding additional logic which takes the form:

```
if (condition 1): do (first thing)
else if (condition 2): do (second thing)
else: do (third thing)
```

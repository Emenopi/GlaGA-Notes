Iteration is performed in programming by use of loops. There are two types of loops:
- For loops (Definite Iteration)
- While loops (Indefinite Iteration)

For loops will run for a predetermined number of times which is set into the code itself.
While loops will continue to run until a certain condition is met, therefore opening up to the possibility of an infinite loop.

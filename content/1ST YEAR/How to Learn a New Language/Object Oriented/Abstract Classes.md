Abstract Classes are [[Classes]] which cannot be instantiated, but only implemented by other Classes.

Abstract Classes provide a common model for classes where the child classes all share the same [[Functions|Methods]] as the abstract class but may differ in algorithm for the methods declared as [[Abstract Methods|Abstract]]

Abstract Classes are similar to [[1ST YEAR/How to Learn a New Language/Object Oriented/Interfaces]] but differ in that they can contain [[1ST YEAR/How to Learn a New Language/Variables/Variables]] and each class can only implement one abstract class

An interface is a set of [[Functions|Method]] signatures which can be used by various classes if they declare that they *implement* the interface.

This allows various unrelated functions to adopt the same methods

Interfaces are similar to [[Abstract Classes]] in that they allow for [[Abstraction]], yet differ in that a [[Class]] can utilise multiple interfaces

If a company is bidding for a project:
- Too high a bid/estimation - lose to competitor
- Too low bid/estimation - lose money

For internal projects:
- Too high estimate - project might not proceed
- Too low estimate - project might overrun -> clients disappointed, concern on future work

Considerations:
- Rewriting existing application?
- Enhancing existing application?
- Trying new business aspect?
- Trying new technology?
- Prototyping?

Good estimation has:
- A notional unit
- Relative estimate not the smallest unit
- Clarifying and questioning requirements
- A benchmark against a completed story
- Previous experience
- At least one expert
- Larger stories split into smaller stories
- Defining smaller units

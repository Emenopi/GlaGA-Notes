A [[Estimation & Planning|Planning]] style which focuses on speed over accuracy using relative units through collaboration with complete team participation in a structured group consensus

- (S)mall, (M)edium, (L)arge (XL) extra large
- Mapped to a number of weeks or range

XL sized items are unknowns or difficult to scope and therefore more research is done to research and breaking down into smaller tasks

Testing serves various purposes:
- Software reliability:
	- Probability the system will fail
	- Mean time til failure (MTTF)
- Prevent known errors and introduction of bugs
	- Happy test: Testing positive scenarios where clean cases go through system successfully
	- Fail scenarios: Testing bad scenarios are caught correctly


There are seven levels of tests:
- Acceptance
- System
- GUI
- API
- Integration
- [[1ST YEAR/Testing & Software Improvement/Unit Testing|Unit Testing]]
- Code review

And six characteristics:
- Functionality:
	- The function and business use of the software
- Usability:
	- Speed and ease of use
- Security / Penetration Testing:
	- Security and survival of attacks
- Performance / Efficiency:
	- Speed and memory usage
- Portability:
	- Deployment on different browsers, operating systems, web, or mobile devices
- Reliability:
	- Resilience to breaks and how quickly it recovers

In general, a high code coverage should be aimed for however there are diminishing returns as that number approaches 100%. Additionally, 100% code coverage does not mean 100% case coverage so may be a misleading indicator

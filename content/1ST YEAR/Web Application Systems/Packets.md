A packet is a segment of a message which can be sent across a network

Allows messages to be sent by quickly switching between packets - Once all packets received, they are combined together to create entire message

Packets can arrive out of order and since they contain an offset which dictates where the packet should be inserted to create the complete message

This also reduces the storage space

In contrast to monolithic applications, a tiered system separates different aspects into different levels

Advantages:
- Each tier can be coded separately by different programmers
- Different tiers can be distributed over network to improve efficiency : provides flexibility and security
- Allow separation of concerns
- Encapsulate complexity : can be broken down into sub-tiers or layers
- Can be replicated across a number of machines : Provides scalability

Needs:
- Well defined interface between tiers
- Internet protocols and database connections

Data redundancy can be in the form of:
	- Ambiguity: Different names for the same thing in different places
	- Inconsistency: Data changes which aren't reflected throughout all references to the same data
	- Wasted effort: Not sharing data where possible to save time and effort

Redundancy indicates poor relational [[Database Design]]

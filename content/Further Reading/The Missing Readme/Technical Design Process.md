- Designing software is not linear process, but spiral
	- Alternates between independent and collaborative work
	- Clarify and refine design at each stage
	- Results in design document
- Prototypes used to validate designs, answer questions, and chose between viable alternatives
- Design leads to implementation
	- Implementation may lead to revising design

### Define Problem

- Ask stakeholders what they perceive to be the problem
	- Which problem is the highest priority?
- Pay attention to scope

### Do Research

- Consider relevant research, alternative solutions, and trade-offs
- Look at how others solved similar problems


### Conduct Experiments

- Write draught code, APIs, and partial implementations
- Run tests
- Idea is to learn, not to polish code

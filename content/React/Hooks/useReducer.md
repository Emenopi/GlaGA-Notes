useReducer is a React [[Hooks|Hook]] for adding a [[Reducer]] to a component for managing state.

useReducer will return the current state and the [[Dispatch]] [[Functions|Function]] for updating [[State]]

Works similarly to useState but allows state updates to be moved to a single function outside of event handlers.

Following discussion with the Team Manager, three main tools were identified as most important to productive workflow within our particular team. For each of these tools, both the benefits, as well as how they integrate together were both identified and discussed within the scope of our own company's approach to their use.

The most important set of tools identified were those pertaining to communications, which was noted as being of particular importance to larger and more global organisations. On a small scale, it was noted that basic forms of communication such as face-to-face and instant messaging may suffice, however the needs for a variety of communication forms grows proportionately to the size and global scale of the company. As a direct response to time differences and departmentalisation of the organisation, additional communication tools are required. Within Wood Mackenzie in particular, Microsoft Teams is used widely for communications which require immediate acknowledgement as well as serving as a substitute for face-to-face meetings, thus allowing participants to attend regardless of location. This latter point is of particular use in response to both globalisation and the facilitation of working from home. Teams is used for both stand-up meetings and interdepartmental meetings within Wood Mackenzie, as well as facilitating pairing between developers regardless of their physical location.

For routine communications as well as those which do not require acknowledgment, email is also widely used. While it would be possible to utilise Teams for these particular topics, maintaining a degree of separation between communication types mitigates the risk of important communications being overlooked or lost amongst a large swath of less urgent messages. One additional benefit to this is the ease of prioritisation of messages as those received in Teams are not only more likely to require acknowledgement, but are also further categorised into personal or group messages and messages relating to a particular meeting or team. For certain types of communications, email allows a trace of previous messages to be kept for reference - a feature which may be of particular interest to those involved in HR or managerial roles.  

Within the scope of work directly related to the [[Development Process]], the main tool required is one which facilitates the tracking of tickets. In Wood Mackenzie, ticket tracking is achieved by use of Jira which has a number of features to support the agile workflow beyond basic ticket tracking. While the ticket tracking feature of Jira satisfies standard criteria such as assignment to team members and tracking of tickets from "To Do" through to "Released to Production", additional features exist for sizing tickets during pre-sprint planning. The latter feature is used alongside Microsoft Team's video calling feature such that tickets can be discussed and voted on somewhat simultaneously by all team members.

The last tool discussed was Figma which, while perhaps may not be of widespread use, provides great value to the teams at Wood Mackenzie. Figma is a digital whiteboarding tool which allows free-form communication, thus facilitating more complex discussions which may prove difficult given the constraints normally imposed upon digital communications. Within Wood Mackenzie in particular, Figma is widely used in retrospective and training sessions to allow the entire team to simultaneously contribute, collaborate, and organise ideas.

In summary, it is clear that communication lies at the core of all other toolsets, therefore provision of sufficient tools for communication is of utmost importance within any organisation. Furthermore, particularly with the rise of globalisation and working from home, access to richer forms of communication provides great value to bridge the gap associated with loss or interference of information normally associated with non face-to-face forms of communication.
